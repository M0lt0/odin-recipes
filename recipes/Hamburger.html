        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>

      <ol>
        <li>
          In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, egg, bread crumbs,
          pepper, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and Worcestershire sauce.
          Form into 8 balls, and flatten into patties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the patties and
          onion in the oil until patties are nicely browned, about 4 minutes per
          side. Remove the beef patties to a plate, and keep warm.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sprinkle flour over the onions and drippings in the skillet. Stir in
          flour with a fork, scraping bits of beef off of the bottom as you
          stir. Gradually mix in the beef broth and sherry. Season with seasoned
          salt. Simmer and stir over medium-low heat for about 5 minutes, until
          the gravy thickens. Turn heat to low, return patties to the gravy,
          cover, and simmer for another 15 minutes.
